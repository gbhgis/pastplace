    <p><b>NB:</b> These are all the names of all the <b>administrative units</b> which we have <b>associated</b> with
      Portsmouth, and you must judge whether all or even any of them are variant names for the place.
      They may well include the names of other locations or areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="firstLi">For cities, the associated administrative units will usually include
        parishes, especially ecclesiastical parishes, one of whose names is the name
        of the city followed by a saint's dedication, with just the saint's name as
        another variant. Parish names will sometimes also include "places" within towns.</li>
      <li>Districts usually contain more than one settlement, and some districts
        had their names changed to take the name of a completely different settlement.
        As we link each administrative unit to just one of our "places", usually the
        <em>last</em> place the unit was named after, in these cases the name for
        a completely different place will appear on this page.</li>
      <li class="lastLi">Similarly, a unit may sometimes be named after a particular settlement
        it contains and sometimes to indicate its location within a higher level unit.
        This was very common among British parliamentary constituencies in rural areas,
        one name referring to their main town and another indicating that they were
        in, say, the southern part of the relevant county.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <p><b>Every name listed here is linked to the particular historical source in which it appears,
        but we cannot claim that these are all the historical names of Portsmouth,
        or that our references are to the first usage of the names.
        Similarly, we have tried to ensure that names included here are not transcription
        errors by ourselves, but it is possible they are the result of errors made when the
        historical sources were printed, or the result of visiting authors or census
        officials mis-hearing local names.</b></p>
